# open-sharex-server
Open-sourced and copyright-free image server written in NodeJS - prioritizing [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)'s uploading style.

## features
- Great API to upload, remove, and generate thumbnails
- Upload via ShareX *and* the website
- Have generated authentication keys to prevent abuse

## roadmap
In no particular order, here are the things I *want* to add at some point.

- Add URL uploading support
- Add basic image manipulation API
- Better OpenGraph/Twitter card support
- Better server-side configuration
- Expiring images (user OR server-set)
- Something similar to the likes of [this thing](https://img.hazy.su/)
- Add OCR (image "reading") to transcribe images

## credits

- Some source code is borrowed from other projects I have made, mainly [my main website](//nrmn.top) and a similar project to this that I've made - [imghostr](https://github.com/normanlol/imghostr).

- The 404 web icon is taken from [clker.com](http://www.clker.com/cliparts/J/h/C/1/o/C/broken-file-icon-th.png).

- Additional icons are from [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons/).

- [Hazycora](https://hazycora.com) for suggesting a good chunk of the features in this project.
