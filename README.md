## Credits

- Some source code is borrowed from other projects I have made, mainly [my main website](//nrmn.top) and a similar project to this that I've made - [imghostr](https://github.com/normanlol/imghostr).

- The 404 web icon is taken from [clker.com](http://www.clker.com/cliparts/J/h/C/1/o/C/broken-file-icon-th.png).
